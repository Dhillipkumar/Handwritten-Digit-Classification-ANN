# Handwritten-Digit-Classification-ANN

Description
Developed an artificial neural network (ANN) model to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. This project aims to achieve high accuracy in recognizing and classifying handwritten digits from 0 to 9. The model is trained on a large dataset of handwritten digit images and utilizes advanced neural network techniques to improve classification performance.

The study involves data preprocessing, model architecture design, and hyperparameter tuning to optimize the performance of the ANN model. The trained model is then deployed into a user-friendly web application using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, and PyCharm, an integrated development environment (IDE). This application allows users to input handwritten digit images through an intuitive interface and provides real-time classification results.

This deployment approach not only showcases the practical applicability of the developed model but also facilitates its integration into educational and research workflows. The project demonstrates the effectiveness of ANN models in image classification tasks and provides a valuable tool for further exploration and experimentation in the field of machine learning and computer vision.
